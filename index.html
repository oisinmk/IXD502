               <blockquote>"  <em>Some brands may disregard Gen Z as too young or too insignificant, but as CEO of Dairy Queen, I've already seen the impact this youthful audience holds. This cohort of teenagers influences the market financially, culturally, technologically, and economically—and this influence will only continue to grow." </em> <cite> John Gainor. </cite>
 </blockquote>

<p class="text">Generational definitions have a slight variance depending on where you look but for the purposes of this article, ‘Generation Z' are those people born between middle 1990s to approximately 2005. Eldest of which are <strong> just starting to enter the workforce.  </strong>
 
 </p>

<p class="text">As Gainor tells us we need to engage with Generation Z because of their <strong>impact on society in relation to the economy, culture, and technology,</strong> in reality, we probably need to widen that focus to cover all aspects of society, because the world experienced by those of us who have come before this new generation was different.  Dr Jean Twenge highlights the importance of research into generational differences which she suggests is really about cultural change, the experience of growing up now as a Generation Z er is different from how it was for Gen X ers growing up in the eighties or the baby boomers growing up in the 1960s or even for myself as a late millennial, born in 1993.  
 
</p>

<p class="text">I can already see the differences in this new generation coming up behind me. My experience was different. I didn't grow up engaging with the digital world in the same way.  The internet did not become commercialised until 1995 and my memory of accessing the internet was from a large, clunky desktop that shared the access point with the home phone. The internet connection was impossibly slow, the downloading of data would mean hours, days even, compared to the <strong>instant access of today.</strong> Mobile phones were a new thing, but even then, they were mainly used for calling. Today the new smartphones provide us with instant internet access, cameras and we can see our friends when we call them.  But as IGen and Millennials researcher, Jason Dorsey tells us "<em> Technology is only new if you remember the way it was before</em>". None of this technology is new to Generation Z, it is the way things are, have always been. 
 </p>

<p class="text">Generation Z has been described as lazy, cheap, demotivated and entitled alongside many other negative characteristics. In March 2018, The Sun newspaper ran an article on Generation Z with the tagline "<em>I'M OFFENDED! Selfish, lazy victims who take offence at everything"</em>.  However, it would appear that <strong>this stereotype is being challenged by an increasingly vocal and articulate body of young people: </strong>
 
</p>

<blockquote>"<em>A general consensus of the older generations is that Generation Z is self-absorbed or materialistic, but anyone that takes so much as a brief peek into our lives knows the opposite is true. Sure, we are very social-media oriented, but we use social media to educate ourselves and each other about a political climate that thrives on our ignorance. Ignorance equals complacency and we refuse to be complacent any longer.</em>"  
<cite> Ryann Morelli, 18, US (The Guardian 2018) </cite>

</blockquote>
               
   <p class="text">In 2017 the BBC commissioned their biggest ever survey of attitudes of 16-22-year-olds, the results revealed a generation wanting to challenge the perceptions from older generations that they were "<em>lazy</em>" and "<em>social media obsessed</em>".  Findings showed young people who believe that they put family life and their studies above socialising and spending time online, who are optimistic about their future and see themselves as "<em>hard-working and creative</em>".

               <p class="text">This article focuses on Generation Z in relation to three key areas: <strong> technology, economic impact and cultural and societal engagement.  </strong>
As Digital Natives: What does it mean to be a digital native and how will it change the way we create, communicate, make money and influence across digital platforms. Spending Power: the economic impact of the generation, the spending power that they currently wield and how their vast influence dictates much of what their elders buy. Cultural and Societal impact: what has moulded Generation Z to be the way they are? Why are they considered to be more interested in diversity, inclusivity and changing the world for the better?

               <blockquote>  " <em>They are the most connected, educated and sophisticated generation in history. They don't just represent the future, they are creating it.</em>"<cite> Mark McCrindle.</cite> </blockquote>
 



<p class="text">First coined by educator and author, Mark Prensky in the year 2001, Digital Native was a term used to describe<strong> people who were born into the age of digital technology.</strong> Digital Natives see technology as something inherently apart of them, unable to comprehend a world without it. Digital technology is a fundamental part of their being. 
 </p>
               

<p class="text">Mark Prensky suggests that Digital Natives<strong> think and process information in a fundamentally different way</strong> when compared to their older counterparts. Digital Natives scan and process information significantly faster, especially when faced with a screen platform, he explores the idea that there needs to be an educational overhaul, from traditional methods to post-digital methods to accommodate Generation Z's <em>evolved</em> needs.  
 

</p>

<p class="text">Many people seemed to think that Generation Z's attention span is much shorter compared to older generations, as a result of over-consumption of their devices, and that this led to the Digital Natives being dubbed as unfocused, disorganized and disinterested, however, according to research conducted by market research firm, Fast Company,<strong>  it isn't that Generation Z have an eight-second attention span, but in fact, a highly developed filter</strong>, that allows the young generation to pick out the important information quickly and efficiently.<em> Could this be a mechanism developed to cope with the information overload they are faced with on a daily basis?  </em>

 </p>

<p class="text">Since the advancement of technology, the way in which we consume entertainment has begun to change. Statistics by Statista show that the world's consumption of live <strong> Television is starting to quickly become obsolete with over a 40% reduction in viewing time for Generation Z over the last seven years.</strong> With the rise of streaming services such as, Netflix, Amazon Prime and NowTv, it has never been easier for people to watch exactly <strong>what they want, when they want it.</strong>  The same goes for the music industry, CD's and music stores have had to adapt in order to remain relevant.  Generation Z <strong>expects this instantaneous gratification  </strong> from their technology with little room for error and very little patience, everything they want is just a click away.  A study by CornerSquare reveals that "<em><strong>60%</strong> of Gen Z will not use an app or website that is too slow to load and <strong>62%</strong> won’t use an app if it’s difficult to navigate" and that "Gen Z shoppers view <strong>62%</strong> more pages during a browsing session than other demographics and bounce <strong>51%</strong> less of the time</em>" 

</p>

<p class="text">Being born into the digital age means growing up alongside the vast scape of the world-wide-web. Having access to the internet from birth has allowed for Generation Z to navigate through information and data faster than any of the generations before them, educating themselves at rapid rates. In the past, one would have to go to the library, find books for specific information or rely on the wisdom passed down from teachers or parents. These Digital Natives acquire the answers to the world's great questions in a matter of seconds. Although this doesn't mean that Generation don't take the using the internet seriously, The Corner Square study also found that "<em><strong>(61%)</strong> cite secure storage and protection of personal data as an important factor, as well as clear terms and conditions <strong>(43%)</strong> and a clear explanation of what data will be collected and for what purpose <strong>(39%)</strong>.</em>" 
 


</p>
              
       <p class="text">Unfortunately, not all internet usage is for education. <strong>Social Media is a platform unique to Generation Z growing up.</strong> As a Millennial, the introduction of social media came in my early teenage years. With Generation Z, however, social media has been an intricate part of their experience from the beginning. According to the NHS,<em> <strong>91%</strong> of 16-24-year-olds use social networking on a daily basis.</em> It has developed from a place to socialize with friends, to create an online brand for themselves and to connect with people from around the globe. The amount of likes, loves or followers that one has, has become somewhat of a new digital currency, the more of those that you get, means the more popular, successful and liked that you are.

</p>
<blockquote>"<em>What if you work up tomorrow, and you had no followers...could you go back to being your normal self?</em>"  <cite>Brittany Furlan  </cite>

               </blockquote>
               <p class="text">This mentality that Generation Z has adopted has led to a significant increase in mental health issues in young people across the globe. According to the NHS, there has been a <em><strong>70%</strong> rise in anxiety and depression diagnosis in young people over the <strong>past 25 years.</strong></em> They believe this rise can be clearly related to the overwhelming pressures that social media puts on young people, the pressure to show how great your life is, your success, your looks and your talents.  



</p>
               
        <p class="text">
Influencers in my time, as a millennial, were mainly professional football players and movie stars, never before had I considered someone from the Internet as such. But, for Generation Z, social media influencers have been on the rise. The 2018 Netflix documentary <em>"The American Meme"</em> by Bert Marcus sheds some light on a sample of social media influencers today, who have risen to fame by creating <em>"empires online"</em> for their global following. The key being, as Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman suggests <em>“What their lack of talent means is: <strong>They could be you. And you could be them.</strong> They're the new trash royalty of Warhol Nation"  </em>



</p>       
               
              <p class="text">One such influencer, Brittany Furlan, rose to internet fame through the short-lived, 6-second clip platform ‘Vine' and then grew her empire using the remainder of the social media platforms.<strong> In 2015, Time magazine named Brittany, along with nine other social media stars, the most influential people on the internet</strong>, a list shared with the likes of the former president, Barack Obama.  




</p> 
               
                            <p class="text">In The American Meme, Brittany discusses the pains and struggles that have come with her internet-born fame: <em>"lonely, that's how lonely we are, we're seeking validation from strangers to love us". </em>The strive for constant perfection and fame seems to have an expiry date for people like Brittany, an unsustainable feat when the world is always watching.

               <p class=text> The spending power that they wield, the impact of their influence, and what exactly they are doing with their money is why the business world, marketers and designers, now and in the future, need to understand Generation Z 
Even though the eldest of Generation Z are only now entering the workforce, they seem to already possess significant spending power. The American based research firm, Berkley, co-pioneered the largest study on Generation Z and Millennials between 2017 and 2018. According to Berkley's findings,<strong> Generation Z wield an estimated $150 billion within the USA alone.</strong> This data was based on allowances and earnings from people aged between seven and twenty-one. This may not appear to be significant when comparing to their elder's spending power, but I think it is important to point out that the<em> majority have not entered the world of work yet.  </em>
 </p>

<p class="text">Barkley's comprehensive study on Generation Z is cited many times in other articles, in particular, their estimated spending power statistic. Marla Tabaka, a successful business advisor with over 25 years of experience cites Berkley's findings in an article for Inc.com. Tabaka suggests,<em>"the buying power of Generation Z is mind-blowing."  </em> Tabaka later compares Generation Z's spending power to a Nielsen study on Multicultural-Millennials spending power. The study suggests that Multicultural-Millennials, who make up almost <strong>50%</strong> of the Millennial population in the USA, have a spending power of <strong>$65 billion.</strong> Generation Z's $150 billion becomes significantly more formidable after reading that report.
</p>

               <blockquote>"<em>Influence is an invisible - yet powerful - force that can't be denied. It impacts our choices every day, whether we realize it or not, influence played a role in our final decision.</em>" <cite>Joseph Cole, VP of Marketing at Tapinfluence. </cite>
               </blockquote>
               <h1> Influence </h1>

<p class="text">Jeff Fromm, an expert on Generation Z, also quoted Berkley's study on spending power in an article for Forbes.com in January 2018,<em> "they account for $29-$143 billion in direct spending. But their impact on the market doesn't start there."</em> Fromm suggests that not only does Generation Z wield, what seems like a significant spending power already, but they also influence other generational spending as well. A 2015 study by Cassandra suggests that<strong> 93% </strong>of parents in the USA admit to being influenced by their children on all household spending, which indicates that Generation Z's economic impact is appreciably larger than their initial estimated spending power of $153 billion. In Fact, according to the 2018 Berkeley study,<strong> Generation Z influence up to an estimated $333 billion in indirect spending in the USA,</strong> which is over double their estimated spending power. Jeff Fromm and Angie Read's published research,<em> "Marketing to Gen Z, The Rules for Reaching This Vast and Very Different Generation of Influencers" </em> elaborate on Generation Z's influence and break down their influence in a number of ways. Fromm and Read argue that due to a change in the traditional family structure, and, that young people now have a vastly increased ability to access information, the family hierarchy has shifted to a democracy with regards to familial decisions. Fromm and Read suggest that the change in family structure from the traditional nuclear family, (a family consisting of the mum, the dad and 2.5 children) has been surpassed by a range of different familial units, and that this has led to parents relying on their children for their say on household purchases and decisions.

<img class="pester-img" src="pester-1.jpg">
<p class="text">
<strong><span>Pester Power</span></strong> - Fromm and Read explain that parents spend an increase of<strong> 30%</strong> when shopping with their children! When the Generation Z'ers are potentially adding a 30% increase to the shopping bill, <em>surely this is reason enough for them to be taken seriously? </em>

 </p>

<p class="text">Generation Z's influence can only continue to grow as it is estimated that they will become the<strong> largest demographic in world's history by 2020,</strong>  according to a study by MNI Targeted Media INC, Generation Z will hold <strong>40%</strong> of the world's population by 2020. Close to consisting of almost half of the global population in a couple of years, as well as their influence on other generational spending, Generation Z is potentially shaping up to be an economic force to be reckoned with. 

               </p>
    
    <p class="text"> 
We know just how much spending power Generation Z possess as well as their significant influence on spending.<em> But what are they actually spending their money on? And why?</em> Contrary to popular belief, that the youngest generation is broke because they spend all their money on avocados and herbal tea, according to Business Insider UK, Generation Z has become a cohort of money-wise savers, their studies suggest that <strong>64% </strong>of Generation Z'ers already have savings accounts, which is a<strong> 15% increase</strong> compared to the older generations. They explain, that due to growing up through the recession and watching their older counterparts struggle in financial turmoil, they have grown more risk averse and frugal in the hopes of providing a more secure future for themselves. They want to own things, and in particular, they want to own their home, not rent it. Author and Journalist, Dan Kadlec of Time.com and Money.com, explains that <em><strong>97%</strong> of American Generation Z'ers believe they will own a home one day</em> which is a significant increase compared to their Millennial siblings. 


               <p class="text"> Nosheen Iqbal, The Observer, suggests in her 2018 article, "<em>Generation Z: We have more to do than drink and take drugs </em>" that the health and wellbeing industry is booming as a result of Generation Z.  Iqbal believes that their risk averse attitude has swayed the normality of teenage drinking and drug taking to a more health conscious approach, that more teenagers are going to the gym, looking after their mental health and eating more responsibly. Iqbal suggests that this is partly due to the information overload that Generation Z has had access to throughout their life. As someone belonging to the younger end of the Millennial spectrum, I see this within my community, especially with my younger brother's Generation Z social circle. 


</p>
             
          <p class="text">  When you consider all of the economical points:</p>
               
                 <ol class="ol-2">
<li>Spending power; currently estimated at $150 billion in the USA. </li>
<li>Their influence; 93% of parents claim that their children influence their spending on all household purchases. And parents spend up to 30% more when shopping with their children.</li>
<li>Population; by 2019 will comprise 32% of the global population, and by 2020, will account 40% of consumers.</li>
<li>Spending Habits; Generation Z’s frugality, saving mentality and health orientated characteristics.</li>
</ol>

      <p class="text">
I think that Generation Z are a young cohort that needs to be taken seriously for designers and businesses alike especially from an economical standpoint.

               <p class=text> The sheer mass in numbers Generation Z have accumulated and will projectably hold within the near future may be cause for serious consideration. What societal influence does Generation Z wield? What events have sculpted their culture and their personalities?<em> What do they want? And will they change the world as we know it? </em>

               <blockquote>"<em>I was raised in a household where I was taught to ask myself "how am I going to make a difference?"  not "if I am going to make a difference." I am a product of my environment, committed to change- making.</em>" <cite>Ziad Ahmed </cite></blockquote>

A 19-year-old CEO, activist and student of Yale University, Ziad Ahmed is one of many influential Generation Z'ers taking to the stage. Ziad Ahmed co-founded a Generation Z marketing consultancy, JÜV consulting, and he is also the founder of, Redefy, a young organization aiming to further equality and inspire change in the world.  Ziad's quote seems to be reflective of the attitudes instilled in the newest generation today, a cohort of change-makers.

We know from earlier Generation Z grew up through the financial strife of the Great Depression in the early 2000’s and 2008, and how this moulded a cohort of young, money-conscious youths, but what other events had such an impact on their characters?

               <p class="text">In the USA, Generation Z'ers grew up through, 9/11 and, The War on Terror, the terrorist demolition of the World Trade Towers in New York City and the subsequent war that ensued it. People may argue that acts of war and terrorist attacks have been happening throughout all of history, however,<em><strong> the one difference that separates Generation Z from their elders, is that they had access to the modern-day internet.</strong></em> The Internet paved the way for information to become instant and global, the children of Generation Z were bombarded with information on the injustices that were happening every day in the world, but they were also able to<em> connect with youth across the globe, to discuss, compare and analyse world events.</em> This possibly could have strengthened their diverse-minded personas. <strong> <em> That regardless of their race, colour or religion they are still hurt the same and thus need to work together in an effort to eradicate inequality and injustice in the world. </em></strong>

     <p class="text">An instance of this banding together in order to eradicate injustice in the USA, is the Generation Z created and led, "<strong>March For Our Lives </strong>" movement born in March 2018, this was a protest and current movement created in response to a rise in school shootings in America, in particular, the shootings at Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida, which saw the killing of 17 students and staff and injuring a further 17, making it the<em><strong> deadliest high school shooting in USA history,</strong></em> more deadly than the famed, Columbine Highschool shootings of 1999. After the initial March For Our Lives demonstration on the 24th of March 2018, and according to an article by Business Insider the movement became<strong><em> one of the largest protests in American history,</em></strong>  with an estimated 1.2 to 2 million turnout in the USA alone. The March For Our Lives movement has evolved into a global crusade over the past year and expanded their mission statement, their aim now is to create a safe environment for the youth of today to grow up in, they state that  "<em> to create a movement that ends the violence and elects morally just leaders into office. We will not stop our advocacy until we see the change we demand.</em>" This part of the mission statement I believe is reflective of the characteristics embodied in the young Generation Z, it seems that they know what they want and that they will fight until they get it. It appears to me that they are able to empower the masses with a contagious-like influence.

      <p class="text">Canadian-born activists Craig and Marc Kielburger are the creators of  "<em><strong>We Day"</strong></em>, a series of programmes created to empower the young generation. The Kielburger brothers believe in the potential of Generation Z, Marc states that "<em>This is an incredibly powerful generation. And ‘We Day' taps into that power. We do not only believe in them but also help unleash what is really great about them.</em>" The success of "We Day" grew from a single day event in Canada into a multi-city and country tour reaching in excess of <strong>650,000 children,</strong> suggesting that Generation Z are engaged and passionate about making a change in the world.

               </blockquote>
   <p class="text"><strong>Inclusivity</strong> and <strong>diversity</strong> are two terms that seem to resonate with Generation Z,  Ben Graham writing for Medium.com suggests that Millennials may have paved the way for a more culturally diverse population, however, Generation Z is the <strong>first generation born into a much more ethnically diverse society</strong>. This seems to be reflected in research done by Goldman Sachs' research analyst Christopher Wolf, "<em>the Census Bureau is actually forecasting that over half of kids in America will belong to a minority race or ethnic group by 2020, so diversity in the traditional sense of the word has actually become the norm.</em>"

   <p class="text">Caroline Jacoby of Adrenaline, a US based design agency, reinforces this idea that Generation Z is culturally diverse and inclusive, "<em>The most culturally diverse population to date</em>" and that they demand "<em>openness and inclusivity… corporate values are no longer a nicety, but a necessity.</em>"  Being born into this ultra-connected and diverse world seems to have given Generation Z this belief in a core value system. Giselle Kovary of Ngen seems to agree with this statement, writing, "<em>members of this cohort don't consider equality to be a "perk" or something that is out of the ordinary. Instead, they fully expect that it will just exist.</em>" Giselle elaborates that Generation Z do not take it for granted, but that they <strong>will not tolerate inequality at all. </strong>Giselle further suggests that if a workplace is not accepting or welcoming of diversity and equality in an organization, it will essentially deter young talent from applying to the company as well as suggesting that productivity can falter as a result.

According to the research agency Wildness, Generation Z <strong>do not want to be spoken for, but they want to proactively engage</strong> in the production of meaning around them, including design elements that they are going to buy into, Wildness dubbed the generation as<em> "Culture Creators"</em> and they believe that In terms of creating for Generation Z  you have to consider that they want to see design that feels authentic and takes into consideration the community as well as the individual and that they are very aware of power, and the social and cultural engagement for good.

   <p class="text">In the United Kingdom, Generation Z appear to have the potential to cause significant political disruption. <strong>Youth turnout in the 2017 General Election was the highest in 25 years</strong> according to Ipsos Mori. The election results just shy of a major upset saw the left-leaning Labour party narrowly missing out on a majority, an election that was originally predicted to be a landslide victory for the Conservatives. The majority of Generation Z according to global public opinion and data company, YouGov, voted Labour with around<strong> 65% of 18-24 year olds</strong> voting the left leaning Labour party.

Generation Z has demonstrated the ability to band together in the millions to fight for what they believe is right,  they can impact the success of businesses if they don't share the values they hold as a given and they have the potential to cause significant political swings. It is difficult to argue that we need to take this young cohort seriously with what they can and have already achieved in their short but event-filled lifespan.

                It is hard to argue whether or not Generation Z will change the world, it is more a matter of<strong> how </strong>they will change it. They are shaping up to be the largest Generation ever in existence and the most globally connected. It is predicted that they are potentially going to be one of the wealthiest generations, but what they will do with their fortunes is unknown, the financially anxious generation is shaping up to be ready for a rainy day.  
They are the most vocal of generations in history due to the advancements in technology and don't seem to be stopping anytime soon.
